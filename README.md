# update 16/07/2017
	insta_beautifullSoup.py
		 Get instagram followers, follow and publish using beautifulsoup4 and insert data into elasticsearch. Is not elegant but works.

		 Inside the scripts you can define the list of instagram users to be tracked.

		 You will need to have a elasticsearh node configured and running, we use a "user1" user for the connection.

# pyscrapping
